# ✨ Airbnb Clone – User Stories

This directory contains user-centered stories that reflect how Guests, Hosts, and Admins interact with the backend system of the Airbnb Clone.

These stories are based on the previously created use case diagram and provide a development roadmap for implementing features like registration, booking, payment, and listing management.
